## Directions
Source: common sense

### preparing the powder
1. Mix all ingredients
2. Put in desired container. Traditionally, [test tubes][aTTube] [were used][tTTube]

> Note: citric acid + sodiumbicarbonate are hydrophillic as hell, don't let any water touch the powder. Even air humidity will mess it up, so be careful!

### drink
I'd recommend to:

1. Mix powder with water
2. Wait for powder to dissolve
3. Drink it

### eat
some people reported to:
* eat the powder
* dip $stuff into the powder and eat $stuff

### snort
go back to kindergarten, will you?
